Welcome to Unidata's Python Training for atmospheric science and meteorology. This site is meant
to be a one-stop website for learning how to use Python for earth-science education and research
for any experience level. New Python users may find the :doc:`Introduction to Python <intro-to-python>`
section a good place to start. Check out the `example gallery`_ for detailed meteorology-specific
examples, or learn advanced usage of the scientific Python ecosystem for atmospheric science with our
:doc:`workshop materials <workshop-intro>`. If you have questions, please contact the Unidata Python team
at our `support email`_.
