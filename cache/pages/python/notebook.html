<p>As discussed in the <a href="introduction.html">introduction</a>, Jupyter notebooks provide a tremendous advantage for scientific computing, analysis and visualization. Here, we will explain how to start a Jupyter notebook. We will present just enough information to get you started. For a more complete treatment of Jupyter notebook software, please read the <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we explained how to download and install a complete Python installation with Anaconda for both <a href="conda-osx.html">Mac OS X</a> and <a href="conda-windows.html">Windows</a>. Armed with this experience, we will demonstrate how to start a Jupyter notebook in order to run code.</p>
<p>The Jupyter Notebook software is included in the Python installation we obtained from Anaconda. There are at least two scenarios in which you may want to run a Jupyter notebook:</p>
<ol>
<li>You aim to further experiment with, or augment, an existing Jupyter notebook like the ones that already exist within a repository in github.</li>
<li>You want to develop a Jupyter notebook or series of notebooks for uses such as supplementing teaching material, or for a scholarly journal article, for example.</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases, you will want to start the Jupyter notebook in a specific folder.</p>
<h3>Starting a Jupyter Notebook in a Specific Folder</h3>
<p>On Mac OS X, create a Desktop folder with the Finder called <code>my-notebook</code>. <a href="conda-osx.html">In the last section</a>, we learned how to start the OS X Terminal. Launch the Terminal again so that we may start Jupyter. Change to that directory (i.e., open the newly created <code>my-notebook</code> folder) with the <code>cd</code> command: <code>cd ~/Desktop/my-notebook</code>. The <code>~</code> character is a shortcut to indicate you are at your home directory.</p>
<p>On Windows, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-new-folder">create a Desktop folder</a> called <code>my-notebook</code>. Hold down the shift key and right-click on the newly created folder. A context menu will appear and there will be an option to, "Open command window here". Click this option to launch the Windows Command Prompt at that specific location.</p>
<p>We can now start our Jupyter notebook with this command:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">jupyter</span> <span class="n">notebook</span>
</pre>


<p>Once entered, this command will automatically launch your default web browser with a new notebook in an empty directory.</p>
<p>To actually create a notebook, go to the New, Python 3 menu item.</p>
<p>Enter some code in the first cell:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">&quot;hello world&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>and press Shift-Enter to actually run the cell yielding</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">hello</span> <span class="n">world</span>
</pre>

<h3>How to Run OPT Jupyter Notebooks</h3>
<p>This project includes a <a href="http://unidata.github.io/online-python-training/index.html#beginning-python-concepts">series of Jupyter notebooks</a> for learning Python with geoscience objectives. They are located in the <code>notebooks</code> folder in the git <code>master</code> branch. In order to clone this project or any projects containing Jupyter notebooks such as the <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/unidata-python-workshop">Unidata Python Workshop</a>, please see the <a href="http://unidata.github.io/online-python-training/index.html#getting-started">section on git and github</a>. Once you have cloned your repository, change directory to where the Jupyter notebooks are located in the repository folder (e.g., the <code>notebooks</code> directory) and start Jupyter with the <code>jupyter notebook</code> command.</p>
<h2>MyBinder and Starting your Jupyter Notebook in the Cloud</h2>
<p>MyBinder is a third option that runs Jupyter notebooks on a cloud server that is setup on your behalf. If the project has enabled MyBinder, you will see a <img src="http://mybinder.org/badge.svg" alt="MyBinder"/> badge on the github project page. MyBinder is available for the Unidata Python Workshop Jupyter notebooks at <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/unidata-python-workshop">this link</a>. See the <a href="http://mybinder.org/">MyBinder</a> website for more information.</p>
