<p>Welcome to Unidata's Python Training for atmospheric science and meteorology. This site is meant
to be a one-stop website for learning how to use Python for earth-science education and research
for any experience level. New Python users may find the <a class="reference external" href="/python/intro-to-python/">Introduction to Python</a>
section a good place to start. Check out the <a class="reference external" href="galleries/">example gallery</a> for detailed meteorology-specific
examples, or learn advanced usage of the scientific Python ecosystem for atmospheric science with our
<a class="reference external" href="/workshop/workshop-intro/">workshop materials</a>. If you have questions, please contact the Unidata Python team
at our <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support-python&#64;unidata.ucar.edu">support email</a>.</p>
